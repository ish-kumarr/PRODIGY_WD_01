# Landing Page with Interactive Navigation Menu

This repository contains the code for a landing page created for a travel website as part of Task 1 of my internship at Prodigy Web Development. The page includes an interactive navigation menu that changes its style when scrolled or hovered over, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page is optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring it looks great on any device.
- **Smooth User Experience**: Designed with user engagement in mind, featuring dynamic visuals and transitions.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the landing page.
- **CSS**: For styling the page and the interactive navigation menu.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the navigation menu, such as detecting scroll events and hover states.

3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the landing page.

## Usage
